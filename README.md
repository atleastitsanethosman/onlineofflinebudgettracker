  # Description
  
This application is a budget tracker, with the ability to continue function through a temporary loss of connection by persisting data into cache, through the use of a service worker. The application also uses indexDB to capture transaction data when offline.  The application takes in deposits and withdrawals to calculate a running balance displayed in a graph below.<br>
